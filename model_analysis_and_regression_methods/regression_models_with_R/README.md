# Some Practical Works

This folder collects a series of practical assignments from my **introduction to Data Science** coursework.  
The focus is on applying **regression techniques, model selection, and generalized models** to real-world datasets, using **R and Jupyter Notebooks**.

## Contents

### 1. Linear Regression with Model Selection
- **Notebook**: `Linear_regression_AIC_BIC_R.ipynb`
- Explores classical linear regression models.
- Applies **Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)** and **Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)** for model selection.
- Highlights the trade-off between model fit and complexity.

### 2. Logistic Regression & Generalized Additive Models (GAMs)
- **Notebook**: `draft_GAM_logistic_regression_R.ipynb`
- Implements **logistic regression** for binary outcomes.
- Extends to **Generalized Additive Models (GAMs)** to capture non-linear relationships.
- Demonstrates interpretation of coefficients and visualization of smooth terms.

### 3. Poisson Regression for Count Data
- **Notebook**: `poissonRegression_modelling_counts_of_doctor_visits.ipynb`
- Models **count data** (doctor visits) using **Poisson regression**.
- Evaluates assumptions such as equidispersion.
- Discusses extensions to handle overdispersion.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Statistical modeling: linear, logistic, and Poisson regression.
- Model selection using **information criteria** (AIC, BIC).
- Application of **generalized additive models (GAMs)**.
- Interpretation of model results and critical evaluation of assumptions.
- Reproducible workflows in **R (via Jupyter notebooks)**.
