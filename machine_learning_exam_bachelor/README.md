# ML Exam Project â€“ Weather Forecasting

**Topic:** Weather forecasting using machine learning  

## Overview
This project was developed as part of my Machine Learning exam. The task was to build and evaluate predictive models for weather forecasting using the **Austin Weather dataset** from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grubenm/austin-weather).

## Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Removed invalid or missing rows.
   - Applied imputation strategies (Simple and KNN).
   - Scaled numerical features and encoded categorical ones.

2. **Model Selection**
   - Implemented ML pipelines with `scikit-learn` and `imblearn`.
   - Explored classifiers such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests.
   - Prepared setup for XGBoost (not fully used due to time limits).

3. **Performance Evaluation**
   - Assessed models using standard metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
   - Compared results to select the best-performing model.

## Technologies
- Python, Jupyter Notebook  
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `imblearn`, `xgboost`

## Key Learning
The project reinforced skills in **data preprocessing, pipeline design, model comparison, and evaluation** for supervised ML tasks, with direct application to a real-world dataset.
